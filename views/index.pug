  p I am a developer passionate about programming. I obtained a Master of Science in robotics and computer science after studying in one of France's best engineering schools and the University Tokyo.

  p I would like to combine my professional experience in the web development industry with what I have learned during my studies to work on complex, innovating and challenging problematics, closer to the engineering field.

  p You might want to check out my #[a(href="/work") professional experiences] first, then head over to my #[a(href="/projects") personal projects] section. I also have some #[a(href="/blog") blog posts] you might want to read. 
  
  p You can dowload a <strong>pdf version</strong> of my resume #[a(href="/downloads/resume.pdf" download="resume_yann_picard") here].

  p If you are located in the US, you might also be interested in the fact that <strong>I am a US citizen</strong> and therefor do not require any visa or sponsorship to work in the United States.

  p If you are interested in getting to know me better after reading some of this website's content, feel free to send me an email at yann.picard95@gmail.com. I would love to get to know you too.

  p Best,
  
  p Yann.
