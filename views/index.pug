  h2 Software Engineer

  p I am a developer passionate about programming ever since I've discovered the field, 7 years ago. My career is currently focused on web development even if I originally come from a more robotics oriented world. 
  
  p I am seeking a position where I would be involved in developing products shipping to large audiences to make their lives better. Security, scalability, usability and complexity are challenges I am looking forward to solving.

  p You might want to check out my #[a(href="/work") professional experiences] first, then head over to my #[a(href="/projects") personal projects] section. I also have some #[a(href="/blog") blog posts] you might want to read. 
  
  p You can dowload a <strong>pdf version</strong> of my resume #[a(href="/downloads/resume.pdf" download="resume_yann_picard") here].

  p If you are located in the US, you might also be interested in the fact that I have the American citizenship and do not require any form of visa to work with you.

  p If you are interested in getting to know me better after reading some of this website's content, feel free to send me an email at yann.picard95@gmail.com. I would love to get to know you too.

  p Best,
  
  p Yann
